# Multiplayer Samples

This Repo contains samples that demonstrates how to enable Local Multiplayer in Mixed Reailty using Unity

If you are using [Meta XR Core SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/meta-xr-core-sdk-269169) v65+ and (Netcode for GameObjects or Photon Fusion 2) the majority of this code has been ported over to [Multiplayer Building Blocks](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/bb-multiplayer-blocks/) which provides a simpler version of this repo that demonstrates how to enable Mixed Reality Local Multiplayer

## Sample Description

The sample contains 3 different Unity Projects. Where each project contains one of the following Networking Layers

- Netcode for GameObjects
- Photon Fusion 1
- Photon Unity Networking 2

In each Unity Project, the Multiplayer Sample contains the following
- **Matchmaking** - Finding Players to play with
- **Player Connection**  - Players joining the same game to play in
- **Colocation** - Players can see the same object in the same position

## Repo Breakdown
